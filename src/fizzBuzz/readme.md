# Fizz Buzz

## Task

Fizz Buzz’s rules are super simple. A group of students sit in a circle and start counting up. Then we add the twists:

- If a number is divisible by 3, the student says “fizz” rather than the number.
- If a number is divisible by 5, they say “buzz” rather than the number.
- If a number is divisible by both, they say “fizz buzz”

## Start here

First implement a simple test for the game described above. 
`test\fizzBuzz\fizzBuzz.spec.ts`

Think about what you want the api to look like...

Make your first test fail by running `npm run test -- fizzBuzz.spec.ts --watch`

Start implementing inside: `src\fizzBuzz\fizzBuzz.ts`

Make your first test pass.

Continue by writing more tests and implementing the whole game of __fizzBuzz__
